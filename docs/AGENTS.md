## ðŸ¤– Welcome, AI Agent!

This document provides instructions for extending and maintaining the Cloudflare Worker GitHub Proxy.

### Core Principles

1.  **Modularity**: Keep features self-contained. Each GitHub API or tool should have its own file.
2.  **Schema-Driven**: Use Zod for all input and output validation. The OpenAPI spec is generated from these schemas.
3.  **Self-Documenting**: Every file needs a docstring. Every complex function needs inline comments.

### How to Extend the API

**Adding a new REST endpoint:**

1.  Find the appropriate namespace file in `src/octokit/rest/`.
2.  Add a new Hono route handler.
3.  Define Zod schemas for the request and response.
4.  Use `@hono/zod-openapi` to register the route with OpenAPI.
5.  Call the corresponding `@octokit/rest` method.

**Adding a new Tool:**

1.  Create a new file in `src/tools/`.
2.  Define the business logic for the tool.
3.  Expose it as a Hono route, following the schema-driven principles above.
4.  Add `x-agent: true` to the OpenAPI metadata for the route.

### Pre-commit Checks

Before submitting your changes, ensure that:

1.  `npm install` has been run.
2.  `wrangler dev` starts without errors.
3.  The `/openapi.json` endpoint is up-to-date and valid.
4.  You have added or updated documentation as needed.
